# Test

Test is a utility used for testing the go structures being generated by oscalkit from the profiles being provided.

NOTE: The downloaded profile that needs to be tested should contain downloadable href links to catalogs and profiles. In case a relative path is provided, replace them with the absolute downloadable link.
```

Run Test
========

```
NOTE: This is a test so output.go (generated using oscalkit cli) should already exist when running this test.
```
