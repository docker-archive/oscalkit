# Test

Test is a utility used for testing the go structures being generated by oscalkit from the profiles being provided.

Prerequisite
======

```
NOTE: The downloaded profile that needs to be tested should contain downloadable href links to catalogs and profiles. In case a relative path is provided, please download the linked catalogs or profiles in test_util/artifacts.
```

Run Test
========
The test can be run using `make test`, this will run the oscalkit `test_util` prior to the reamining tests.

Otherwise the test can be run using,  `sh RunTest.sh -p <path to the downloaded profile to be tested>`

This will run `cli/main.go generate code` with the provided path and then run `test_util/src/*.go` with the provided path.

To run only the test without the `cli/main.go generate code` in case `output.go` already exists run:
 

`go run test_util/src/*.go -p <path to the downloaded profile to be tested>`
